# homad

This repository contains all the configuration of my [HashiCorp Nomad](https://nomadproject.io) deployment in my
home server-rack. It is deployed in a high-availability configuration using both [HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) 
and [HashiCorp Consul](https://www.consul.io/).

Everything within this repository is managed using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), including deployment of 
workloads in Nomad.
